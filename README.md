# Hotel_reviews_2

In this second project, we will see how trying completely new different techniques, 
compared with the first assignment, we can predict whether or not a review is positive 
or negative, speeding up the process thanks to Dask or predicting with a complex 
Recurrent Neural Network.

The forecasting task achieves an accuracy in the predictions superior to 92%. 
Also, we will visualize the data with a living connection to a MongoDB database, in a 
visualization that follows the Mantra of visualization principles, using Dash.
